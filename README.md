proq is a vibe coding IDE built for shipping quality software. It's a kanban board for CLI-based agentic coding agents — designed to make sense of multi-agent capability and make us better at our real job: defining what we want.

Under the hood it's a tmux task runner that bolts up to your favorite command line agent. It works out of the box with subagents, MCPs, worktrees, and whatever config you bring along. You can also edit proq using proq.

## Quick Start

You'll need **Node.js 18+** and the **[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** on your PATH. The setup script handles everything else (tmux, build tools, npm install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xc00010ff/proq.git
cd proq
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) and you're in.


## How It Works

1. **Create tasks** on the board — manually, or via any chat agent that talks to the API
2. **Drag to "In Progress"** — proq launches a Claude Code instance in a tmux session against that project's codebase
3. **Agent works autonomously** — writes code, commits, then calls back to the API to move itself to "Verify"
4. **Human reviews** — approve to "Done" or kick back to "Todo"

```
Todo ──→ In Progress ──→ Verify ──→ Done
          (agent launches)  (agent calls back)  (human approves)
```


## API

All endpoints live under `/api/projects`. Any assistant agent or script can create and manage tasks programmatically.

| Endpoint | Methods | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/projects` | GET, POST | List or create projects |
| `/api/projects/[id]` | GET, PATCH, DELETE | Single project CRUD |
| `/api/projects/[id]/tasks` | GET, POST | List or create tasks |
| `/api/projects/[id]/tasks/[taskId]` | PATCH, DELETE | Update or delete task |
| `/api/projects/[id]/tasks/reorder` | PUT | Bulk reorder from drag-drop |
| `/api/projects/[id]/git` | GET, POST, PATCH | Branch state and switching |
| `/api/projects/[id]/chat` | GET, POST | Chat/activity log |


## Under the Hood

### Architecture

proq is a Next.js 16 app (App Router) with file-based JSON storage via local lowdb — no external database needed.

```
src/
├── app/api/projects/       # REST API (projects, tasks, git, chat)
├── components/             # React UI (Sidebar, KanbanBoard, TaskCard, etc.)
└── lib/
    ├── agent-dispatch.ts   # tmux launch, abort, queue processing
    ├── worktree.ts         # Git worktree + branch operations
    ├── db.ts               # lowdb database layer
    └── types.ts            # TypeScript interfaces
```

**Data storage:**
- `data/workspace.json` — Project registry
- `data/projects/{id}.json` — Per-project tasks and chat history
- `data/` is gitignored — each user gets their own local state

### Parallel Mode & Worktrees

In parallel mode, each task gets its own git worktree and branch (`proq/{shortId}`). This means multiple agents can work on the same codebase simultaneously without stepping on each other.

The merge into main is **deferred** — the branch stays alive through "Verify" so you can preview changes before they land:

- **In Progress → Verify**: Worktree stays. Branch is available in the TopBar branch switcher.
- **Verify → Done**: Checks out main → merges branch → removes worktree. On conflict, the task stays in Verify for manual resolution.

**Preview flow:** Click "Preview" on a running task to create a disposable `proq-preview/{shortId}` branch at the same commit. The dev server hot-reloads to show the agent's work. Polling fast-forwards every 5 seconds to pick up new agent commits.

Auto-stash keeps your uncommitted work safe — changes are stashed before branch switches and popped when you return to main.

### Dispatch Lifecycle

The dispatch system is centralized through `processQueue(projectId)` — a single function that reads all tasks and decides what to launch next, with a re-entrancy guard per project.

```
dispatch: "queued"    → Waiting in line (or for processQueue to pick it up)
dispatch: "starting"  → processQueue selected it, tmux is launching
dispatch: "running"   → Agent is actively working
dispatch: null        → Not dispatched
```

Dragging a task back to "Todo" aborts the agent (kills the tmux session), then `processQueue()` picks up the next queued task automatically.
